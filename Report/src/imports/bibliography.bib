The BPS is a typical multi-variable nonlinear system which is a two dimensional expansion of the ball and beam system. Four strategies are proposed for static and dynamic position tracking: PID, LQR, Sliding Mode and Fuzzy controller. The results of simulation and also the validation on real system are provided.

The system includes the quadratic metal plate, which is movably fixed in the center. Its inclination can be changeable in two rectangular directions. For the inclination of the plate a servo-drive with a controller and two stepping motors are used. The control problem of the described system is to hold the freely rolling ball in the specific position on the plate. For measuring the ball position, the intelligent video system composed from CCD camera, picture-framing interface and program equipment for real-time picture processing are used. According to the characteristics of the object dynamic a discrete lead compensator was chosen as a controller. Performing experiments up to the sample of a ball on the plate, the modern method of experimenting, called "Rapid Prototyping", has been chosen. The main aim was to pass over the phase of simulation up to the real object experiments with the least changes possible.},

	abstract = {Una plataforma bola-placa es un ejemplo común de sistema dinámico utilizado para aplicar los conceptos de modelado y control estudiados en algunos cursos de ingeniería. En este tipo de sistemas, un cuerpo esférico se coloca sobre una placa móvil con dos grados de libertad. El sistema es accionado por dos servomotores que provocan el desplazamiento de la esfera en los ejes x e y en el plano de la plataforma. Se sabe que dicho sistema es altamente inestable y no lineal. Inicialmente, a partir de un análisis fenomenológico se obtuvo una representación del sistema en el espacio de estado. A continuación, un controlador de realimentación de estado basado en el método de asignación de polos fue diseñado para mantener una posición deseada de la esfera sobre el plano. Una técnica de visión por computador fue usada para medir la posición bidimensional de la esfera sobre el plano en tiempo real. El modelado de la planta en estudio y el diseño del controlador para el posicionamiento de la esfera se validaron experimentalmente considerando diferentes puntos de ajuste. Los resultados obtenidos mostraron que el controlador diseñado es estable y responde satisfactoriamente a las perturbaciones de posición de la esfera alrededor del punto de referencia.
A ball-and-plate platform is a common example of the dynamical system used to apply modeling and control concepts studied in some engineering courses. In this kind of systems, a spherical body is positioned on a mobile plate with two degrees of freedom. The system is operated by two servo motors that cause displacement of the sphere in the x and y axis in the plane of the platform. It is known that such a system is highly unstable and non-linear. Initially, from a phenomenological analysis we obtained a state-space representation of the system. Then, a state feedback controller using the pole assignment method was designed to maintain a desired position of the sphere over the plane. A computer vision technique allowed us measuring the two-dimensional position of the sphere over the plane in real time. Model of the plant under study and controller design for sphere positioning were experimentally validated considering different set-points. Obtained results let us know that our plant-controller is stable and responds satisfactorily to position disturbances around a reference point.},

The platform uses a resistance touch panel as a sensor and servo motors as actuators. The complete control system stabilizing the ball on the platform is realized with the Arduino microcontroller and the Matlab/Simulink software. Two processes required to acquire measurement signals from the touch panel in two perpendicular directions X and Y, are discussed. The first process includes the calibration of the touch panel, and the second process - the filtering of measurement signals with the low pass Butterworth filter. The obtained signals are used to design the algorithm of the ball stabilization by decoupling the global system into two local subsystems. The algorithm is implemented in a soft real time system. The parameters of both PID controllers (PIDx and PIDy) are tuned by the trial-error method and implemented in the microcontroller. Finally, the complete control system is tested at the laboratory stand.},

The modeling errors caused by such approximation are compensated for by H∞ controller that treats the error as disturbance.
