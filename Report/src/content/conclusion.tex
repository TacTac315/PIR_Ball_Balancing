\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, our project aimed to develop a 3DOF Stewart platform with ball position regulation. Throughout the course of our work, we made several key findings.
\newline\newline
Firstly, the ball detection algorithm using a camera proved to be highly effective. It successfully detected and tracked the ball's position, providing reliable data for our control system.
\newline
Secondly, the Simscape digital twin model of the system worked well, accurately representing the dynamics of the platform. However, it is important to note that the model does not include the ball, which limits its comprehensive representation of the entire system.
\newline
Lastly, we encountered challenges in setting up the PID controller for the real model. Due to various difficulties, we were unable to fully implement and optimize the controller in practice. This serves as an area for future improvement and further development.
\newline\newline
Overall, while we achieved success in certain aspects, such as the ball detection algorithm and the performance of the Simscape digital twin model, our project faced limitations in the practical implementation of the PID controller. Moving forward, addressing these challenges and refining the control system would be crucial to fully realize the potential of the 3DOF Stewart platform with ball position regulation using a PID controller.
